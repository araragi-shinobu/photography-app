2. System geocodes location to get coordinates
3. Fetches weather forecast from Open-Meteo
4. Calculates sun times from Sunrise-Sunset API
5. Computes golden/blue hours mathematically:
   - Golden Hour Morning: sunrise ‚Üí sunrise + 1 hour
   - Golden Hour Evening: sunset - 1 hour ‚Üí sunset
   - Blue Hour Morning: sunrise - 30 min ‚Üí sunrise
   - Blue Hour Evening: sunset ‚Üí sunset + 30 min

## Photography Tips

### Golden Hour Shooting
- Arrive 30 minutes early
- Shoot with sun behind subject for backlit glow
- Great for skin tones and warm colors
- Shadows are long and interesting

### Blue Hour Shooting
- Bring a tripod (longer exposures needed)
- Shoot in RAW for better color grading
- City lights look amazing against blue sky
- Perfect balance between ambient and artificial light

### Weather Considerations
- **Clear sky**: Harsh midday light, great golden hour
- **Partly cloudy**: Interesting skies, good all day
- **Overcast**: Soft, diffused light, great for portraits
- **Rain**: Reflections, moody atmosphere, bring protection

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find weather information"
- Check destination spelling
- Try more specific location (e.g., "Tokyo, Japan" instead of just "Tokyo")
- Try major city nearby

### Times seem wrong
- Times are shown in local timezone of the destination
- Account for daylight saving time changes
- Double-check your trip date

### Weather not updating
- Click "Refresh data" button
- Weather is fetched when you open the trip
- Data is cached temporarily

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

- [ ] Multi-day forecasts
- [ ] Moon phase information
- [ ] Tide times (for coastal photography)
- [ ] Cloud cover percentage
- [ ] Wind speed (for long exposures)
- [ ] Historical weather data
